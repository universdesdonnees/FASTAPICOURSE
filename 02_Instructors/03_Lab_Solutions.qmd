## Overview

In this lab, students will delve into the deployment and enhancement of FastAPI applications, focusing on practical applications in machine learning and social media interaction. 

This lab will not only teach students how to build and deploy an API but also how to extend its functionality and make it robust and scalable.

May the code be with them! ðŸŒŸ

## Goals

You will help students achieve the following:

- Understand the deployment process of a FastAPI application on Heroku, including environment setup, file creation, and troubleshooting.
- Learn to extend an existing FastAPI application with new endpoints for functionalities such as image uploads and processing.
- Gain hands-on experience with handling images in a web application environment, including uploading, processing, and generating outputs.
- Acquire skills in fetching and processing data from external APIs, focusing on tasks such as retrieving tweets based on specific queries.
