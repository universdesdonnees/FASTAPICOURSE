Welcome to the **HealthPredictor Project** guide! 

This document outlines the framework for delivering the **HealthPredictor project**, designed for students to develop a comprehensive full-stack healthcare application. 

This project combines machine learning, FastAPI for the backend, and a modern frontend framework. Through this experience, students will gain valuable insights and hands-on skills relevant to real-world healthcare challenges.

## Project Objectives

By the end of this project, students will be able to:

1. **Develop a FastAPI application** with machine learning capabilities to predict health risks based on user input.
2. **Create a responsive frontend** using a JavaScript framework (React, Vue.js, or Angular) that interacts seamlessly with the backend.
3. **Implement RESTful API endpoints** for data management and predictions.
4. **Deploy the application** using Docker and set up Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines for automated deployment.
5. **Apply best practices in software development**, including code organization, documentation, and testing methodologies.

## Project Structure and Phases

[The FastAPI FullStack template](https://github.com/fastapi/full-stack-fastapi-template)

### Phase 1: Research and Planning (1 week)

- **Activities**:
  - Students select a healthcare dataset (e.g., heart disease, diabetes, or other relevant datasets).
  - Outline the features and functionalities of the application, including user input forms and prediction results.
  - Design the database schema, ensuring it meets the application's requirements.

- **Deliverables**:
  - **Dataset Selection Document**: Justification for the chosen dataset and its relevance to the project.
  - **Project Feature List**: A comprehensive list of features and functionalities.
  - **Initial Wireframe Designs**: Mockups of the user interface and user experience.
  - **Database Schema Diagram**: Visual representation of the database structure.

### Phase 2: Backend Development (2 weeks)

- **Activities**:
  - Develop the FastAPI application to handle backend logic.
  - Create scripts for building and training machine learning models using libraries like scikit-learn or TensorFlow.
  - Implement SQLAlchemy for database management, ensuring proper connections to the selected relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL or SQLite).

- **Deliverables**:
  - **FastAPI Application Code**: Codebase for the backend with endpoints for model training, predictions, and CRUD operations.
  - **API Documentation**: Auto-generated documentation using Swagger, including endpoint specifications.
  - **Database Migration Scripts**: Scripts to set up the database schema and tables.

### Phase 3: Frontend Development (2 weeks)

- **Activities**:
  - Build the user interface using Streamlit, React, Vue.js, or Angular, ensuring it is intuitive and user-friendly.
  - Integrate the frontend with the FastAPI backend using Axios or Fetch API for data transmission.
  - Implement data visualization components to present prediction results and insights.

- **Deliverables**:
  - **Frontend Codebase**: Complete code for the user interface.
  - **User Interface Designs**: Documentation on UI components and their functionalities.
  - **API Integration Documentation**: Guidelines on how the frontend interacts with the backend.

### Phase 4: Testing and Deployment (1 week)

- **Activities**:
  - Conduct thorough testing of the application for functionality, usability, and performance.
  - Containerize both backend and frontend applications using Docker to simplify deployment.
  - Deploy the applications to cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, Heroku, or Azure) and set up CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions or similar tools.

- **Deliverables**:
  - **Test Cases and Results**: Documentation of testing strategies and results obtained.
  - **Dockerfiles**: Configuration files for containerizing both applications.
  - **Deployment Instructions**: Comprehensive guidelines for deploying the application, including CI/CD pipeline configurations.
