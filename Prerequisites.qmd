## üíª Must-Have Skills

1. Basic Knowledge of Python Programming
    - You've danced with Python 3 before, right? Make sure you're comfortable with:
        - Variables, loops, and conditionals: The bread and butter of any Python script.
        - Functions, modules, and packages: Your toolkit for building reusable code.
        - Data structures: Lists, dictionaries, sets, and tuples‚Äîyour data's best friends.
        - Error handling: Mastering the art of `try-except` to keep your code running smoothly.
    - And of course, you know your way around `pip` for installing those nifty Python packages.

2. Understanding of Web Development Concepts 
    - Get cozy with the web's lingua franca:
        - HTTP: Know your GETs from your POSTs, and how the web talks back and forth.
        - REST APIs: The secret handshake of web services‚Äîunderstand the principles and how they connect with clients.
        - JSON: The universal data format‚Äîlike the Esperanto of the web!

3. Basic Command Line Skills:
    - The command line is your command center:
        - Navigate directories and run scripts like a pro.
        - Manage virtual environments with `venv` or `virtualenv`‚Äîyour sandbox for Python projects.

4. Familiarity with Version Control (Git):
    - Git is your time machine for code:
        - Clone, commit, and push your way through repositories.
        - Branching and pull requests? You've got this at a basic level.

5. Basic Knowledge of Databases:
    - SQL and relational databases are your data's home:
        - Understand tables, relationships, and basic queries (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).
    - Schemas and migrations? Nice to know, but not a dealbreaker.

6. Exposure to Docker and Containers (Optional but recommended):
    - Docker is your ship for deploying apps:
        - Grasp the basics of containerization and commands like `docker build` and `docker run`.
    - Deployment practices (Heroku, AWS)? Handy, but not essential.

7. Machine Learning (for specific modules):
    - If you're eyeing the Machine Learning module, brush up on:
        - The ML workflow: training, testing, and deploying models.
        - Python ML libraries like `scikit-learn`, `PyCaret`, or `MLflow`.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Software Requirements

1. Python 3.7+: Your trusty Python interpreter.
2. Text Editor/IDE: Whether it's Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, or another favorite, make sure it's ready to go.
3. Docker: For those deployment adventures.
5. Git: Installed and ready, with a GitHub account for version control.
