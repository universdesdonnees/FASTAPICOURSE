Basic Knowledge of Python Programming\n    - You've danced with Python 3 before, right? Make sure you're comfortable with:\n        - Variables, loops, and conditionals: The bread and butter of any Python script.\n        - Functions, modules, and packages: Your toolkit for building reusable code.\n        - Data structures: Lists, dictionaries, sets, and tuples‚Äîyour data's best friends.\n        - Error handling: Mastering the art of `try-except` to keep your code running smoothly.\n    - And of course, you know your way around `pip` for installing those nifty Python packages.\n\n2. Understanding of Web Development Concepts \n    - Get cozy with the web's lingua franca:\n        - HTTP: Know your GETs from your POSTs, and how the web talks back and forth.\n        - REST APIs: The secret handshake of web services‚Äîunderstand the principles and how they connect with clients.\n        - JSON: The universal data format‚Äîlike the Esperanto of the web!\n\n3. Basic Command Line Skills:\n    - The command line is your command center:\n        - Navigate directories and run scripts like a pro.\n        - Manage virtual environments with `venv` or `virtualenv`‚Äîyour sandbox for Python projects.\n\n4. Familiarity with Version Control (Git):\n    - Git is your time machine for code:\n        - Clone, commit, and push your way through repositories.\n        - Branching and pull requests? You've got this at a basic level.\n\n5. Basic Knowledge of Databases:\n    - SQL and relational databases are your data's home:\n        - Understand tables, relationships, and basic queries (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).\n    - Schemas and migrations? Nice to know, but not a dealbreaker.\n\n6. Exposure to Docker and Containers (Optional but recommended):\n    - Docker is your ship for deploying apps:\n        - Grasp the basics of containerization and commands like `docker build` and `docker run`.\n    - Deployment practices (Heroku, AWS)? Handy, but not essential.\n\n7. Machine Learning (for specific modules):\n    - If you're eyeing the Machine Learning module, brush up on:\n        - The ML workflow: training, testing, and deploying models.\n        - Python ML libraries like `scikit-learn`, `PyCaret`, or `MLflow`.\n\n## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Software Requirements\n\n1. Python 3.7+: Your trusty Python interpreter.\n2. Text Editor/IDE: Whether it's Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, or another favorite, make sure it's ready to go.\n3.
