Environment Setup \n1. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment\n- Open your terminal or command line interface.\n- Create a virtual environment with the following command:\n\n```bash\npython3 -m venv env\n```\n\nActivate the virtual environment:\n\nOn Linux and macOS:\n\n```bash\nsource env/bin/activate\n```\nOn Windows:\n\n```bash\nenv\\Scripts\\activate\n```\n\n2. Install FastAPI and Uvicorn using pip:\n\n```bash\npip install fastapi[standard]\npip install uvicorn[standard]\n```\n\nVerify the installation by checking the FastAPI version:\n\n```bash\nfastapi --version\n```\n\nSave the installed packages to a requirements.txt file so others can replicate your setup:\n\n```bash\npip freeze > requirements.txt\n```\n\n### 2. Write and Test Your First FastAPI Application\n\n- Create a new file and name it `app.py`. This will be your main application file.\n- At the top of your `app.py` file, import the `FastAPI` class to initialize your application.\n- Initialize a FastAPI application by creating an instance of the `FastAPI` class. This instance will be used to define your API endpoints.\n- Use the `@app.get(\"/\")` decorator to define a function that handles GET requests to the root path (`/`).\n- Inside the function, return a dictionary that includes a key-value pair where the key is `\"message\"` and the value is `\"Hello World\"`. This will automatically be converted to a JSON response.\n- Open your terminal and navigate to the directory containing your `app.py` file.\n- Use the following command to start the FastAPI application with Uvicorn:\n\n```bash\nuvicorn app:app --reload\n```\n- In this command, `app:app` specifies the module name (`app`) and the FastAPI instance (`app`).\n- Open a web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.\n- You should see a JSON response displaying `{\"message\": \"Hello World\"}`.\n- Visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs` to view the automatically generated documentation for your API.\n\n### 3. Adding Path Parameters\n\n- In your `app.py` file, add **two new endpoints** that utilize path parameters. \n- Create a function named `read_message` that accepts a `message` string parameter and returns it.\n- Create another function named `read_number` that accepts a `number` integer parameter and returns it.\n- For each endpoint, define a function that takes the path parameter as an argument. Ensure the function processes this parameter and includes it in the response.\n- Use type hints (e.g., `str` for text, `int` for numbers) to specify the expected data type of each path parameter.\n- Use Python's `enum` module to define an Enum class.\n- Define your Enum class, `PeopleName`, which inherits from both `str` and `Enum`. This allows your Enum members to behave like strings.\n- Inside the class, define each family member as a class variable, setting its value to the respective string : \"Marc,\" \"Marie,\" and \"Josette.\"\n- Create an endpoint that accepts a path parameter of type `PeopleName`.\n- Use the `@app.get()` decorator to define the endpoint path, incorporating the Enum as a path parameter.\n- Define the function `get_person` to handle the request, using `PeopleName` as the type for the path parameter.\n- Inside the function, use `if` statements to compare the parameter against Enum members and return corresponding messages.\n\n### 4. Data Validation with Pydantic Models\n\n1. **Simple Model**\n\n- In your `app.py` file, define a Pydantic model named `User` to structure incoming data.The model should include the following fields:\n  - `name`: a string representing the user's name.\n  - `email`: an email string, using Pydantic's `BaseModel` and `EmailStr` types for validation.\n  - `age`: an integer representing the userâ€™s age.\n- Use the `@app.post(\"/users/\")` decorator to create a POST endpoint.\n- Implement a function named `create_user` that accepts a `User` model instance as the request body.\n- Return a JSON response confirming the creation of the user, including the validated user data.\n\n2. **Nested Models**\n\n- In your `app.py` file, define a `BaseModel` class named `Address` with fields for `street`, `city`, `state`, and `zip_code`.\n- Create another `BaseModel` class named `UserWithAddress` that includes fields for `name` (string), `email` (string), `age` (integer), and an `address` field of type `Address` to nest the address model within the user model.\n- Use the `@app.post(\"/users-with-address/\")` decorator to define a POST endpoint.\n- Implement a function named `create_user_with_address` that accepts a `UserWithAddress` model instance as the request body.\n- Return a JSON response confirming the creation of the user with the nested address data.\n\n3. **Using Default Values**\n\n- In your `app.py` file, create a Pydantic model named `Item` with fields: `name` (string), `price` (float), and `is_available` (boolean) with a default value of `True`.\n- Use the `@app.post(\"/items/\")` decorator to define a POST endpoint.\n- Implement a function named `create_item` that accepts an `Item` model instance.\n- Return a JSON response confirming the creation of the item, including the default `is_available` field if not provided.\n\n4. **Validating Data with Constraints**\n\n- In your `app.py` file, create a Pydantic model named `Product` with fields: `name` (use `constr` to specify a minimum and maximum length), `price` (float), and `quantity` (integer).\n- Use the `@app.post(\"/products/\")` decorator to define a POST endpoint.\n- Implement a function named `create_product` that accepts a `Product` model instance.\n- Return a JSON response confirming the creation of the product, ensuring that the name adheres to the specified length constraints.\n\n5. **Using Lists and Optional Fields**\n\n- In your `app.py` file, create a Pydantic model named `Order` with fields: `item_name` (string), `quantity` (integer), and an optional `notes` (string) field.\n- Create another model named `Cart` with fields: `user_id` (integer) and `items` (list of `Order` instances).\n- Use the `@app.post(\"/carts/\")` decorator to define a POST endpoint.\n- Implement a function named `create_cart` that accepts a `Cart` model instance.\n- Return a JSON response confirming the creation of the cart with the list of orders.\n\n6. **Complex Data Types**\n\n- In your `app.py` file, create a Pydantic model named `Configuration` with fields: `setting_name` (string) and `value` (string).\n- Create another model named `System` with fields: `name` (string) and `configurations` (dictionary with string keys and `Configuration` values).\n- Use the `@app.post(\"/systems/\")` decorator to define a POST endpoint.\n- Implement a function named `create_system` that accepts a `System` model instance.\n- Return a JSON response confirming the creation of the system with its configurations.\n\n### 5. Simulate a Database and Implement CRUD Operations for Cars\n\n1. **Simulate a Database:**\n   - In your `app.py` file, create a dictionary named `cars_db` to simulate a database for storing car data.\n   - Ensure that each car entry is indexed by a unique identifier (e.g., an integer ID).\n\n2. **Define a Pydantic Model for Cars:**\n   - Create a Pydantic model named `Car` with the following fields:\n     - `brand`: a string representing the car's brand.\n     - `model`: a string representing the car's model.\n     - `date`: a datetime object representing the car's manufacture date.\n     - `price`: a float representing the car's price.\n\n3. **Implement CRUD Operations:**\n\n   - **Create (POST Endpoint):**\n     - Use the `@app.post(\"/cars/\")` decorator to define a POST endpoint.\n     - Implement a function named `add_car` that:\n       - Accepts a `Car` model instance.\n       - Assigns a unique ID to each new car by calculating the length of `cars_db` plus one.\n       - Stores the car in `cars_db` using the assigned ID.\n       - Returns a JSON response confirming the addition of the car.\n\n   - **Read (GET Endpoints):**\n     - **Get All Cars:**\n       - Use the `@app.get(\"/cars/\")` decorator with `response_model=List[Car]` to define an endpoint that returns all cars.\n       - Implement a function named `get_all_cars` that returns a list of all values in `cars_db`.\n\n     - **Get a Specific Car by ID:**\n       - Use the `@app.get(\"/cars/{car_id}\")` decorator to define an endpoint that retrieves a car by its ID.\n       - Implement a function named `get_car` that:\n         - Accepts `car_id` as a path parameter.\n         - Checks if the car exists in `cars_db`.\n         - Returns the car if found, or raises an HTTP 404 exception if not found.\n\n   - **Update (PUT Endpoint):**\n     - Use the `@app.put(\"/cars/{car_id}\")` decorator to define an endpoint for updating car details.\n     - Implement a function named `update_car_price` that:\n       - Accepts `car_id` and a `Car` model instance.\n       - Checks if the car exists in `cars_db`.\n       - Updates the price of the car (e.g., increases it by 10%).\n       - Returns a JSON response confirming the update, or raises an HTTP 404 exception if not found.\n\n   - **Delete (DELETE Endpoint):**\n     - Use the `@app.delete(\"/cars/{car_id}\")` decorator to define an endpoint for deleting a car.\n     - Implement a function named `delete_car` that:\n       - Accepts `car_id` as a path parameter.\n       - Checks if the car exists in `cars_db`.\n       - Deletes the car if found and returns a confirmation message, or raises an HTTP 404 exception if not found.\n\n### 6. Customizing FastAPI API Documentation\n\n**1. Customize API Metadata**\n\n- **Set Title, Description, and Version:**\n  - When initializing your FastAPI instance, you can define a custom title, description, and version for your API. This information will be displayed prominently on your API's documentation page.\n  \n  ```python\n  from fastapi import FastAPI\n\n  app = FastAPI(\n      title=\"Recipe and Movie Collection API\",  # Custom API title\n      description=\"An API for managing recipes and movie collections. Manage, retrieve, and share your favorite items!\",  # Custom description\n      version=\"1.0.0\",  # Version of your API\n  )\n  ```\n\n- **Add Tags with Descriptions:**\n  - Use the `openapi_tags` parameter to categorize endpoints and add descriptions. This helps users understand different sections of your API.\n  \n  ```python\n  tags_metadata = [\n      {\n          \"name\": \"Introduction\",\n          \"description\": \"Basic introduction endpoints to get started.\",\n      },\n      {\n          \"name\": \"Recipe Management\",\n          \"description\": \"Endpoints for managing recipes including adding, retrieving, and deleting recipes.\",\n      },\n      {\n          \"name\": \"Movie Collection\",\n          \"description\": \"Endpoints for managing movie collections, including adding, retrieving, and deleting movies.\",\n      },\n  ]\n\n  app = FastAPI(\n      openapi_tags=tags_metadata  # Apply tags metadata to FastAPI instance\n  )\n  ```\n\n**2. Enhance Endpoint Documentation**\n\n- **Add Detailed Docstrings:**\n  - For each endpoint, provide comprehensive docstrings that explain the endpoint's purpose, input parameters, and expected responses. This enhances the auto-generated documentation and helps users understand how to interact with your API.\n\n  ```python\n  @app.get(\"/\", tags=[\"Introduction\"])\n  async def index():\n      \"\"\"\n      Returns a welcome message to introduce users to the API.\n\n      **Response:**\n      - `200`: A welcome message string.\n      \"\"\"\n      return {\"message\": \"Welcome to the Recipe and Movie Collection API!\"}\n  ```\n\n  ```python\n  @app.post(\"/recipes/\", tags=[\"Recipe Management\"])\n  async def add_recipe(recipe: Recipe):\n      \"\"\"\n      Add a new recipe to the collection.\n\n      **Request Body:**\n      - `title`: (string) The title of the recipe.\n      - `ingredients`: (list) The ingredients required.\n      - `instructions`: (string) The steps to prepare the recipe.\n\n      **Response:**\n      - `200`: Success message and the new recipe.\n      \"\"\"\n      # Recipe handling logic here\n      pass\n  ```\n\n**3. Further Customization**\n\n- **Add Contact, License, and Terms of Service Information:**\n  - Provide additional context about your API by including contact details, licensing information, and terms of service. This is especially useful for public or enterprise APIs.\n\n  ```python\n  app = FastAPI(\n      title=\"Recipe and Movie Collection API\",\n      description=\"An API for managing recipes and movie collections.\",\n      version=\"1.0.0\",\n      contact={\n          \"name\": \"API Support Team\",\n          \"email\": \"support@example.com\",\n          \"url\": \"https://example.com/support\"\n      },\n      license_info={\n          \"name\": \"MIT License\",\n          \"url\": \"https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT\",\n      },\n      terms_of_service=\"https://example.com/terms/\"\n  )\n  ```\n\n### 7. Putting It All Together\n\n<div class=\"video_holder\">\n  <video controls>\n    <source src=\"/01_Exercises/Putting It All Together.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\n    Your browser does not support the video tag.\n  </video>\n</div>\n\n1. **Setting Up the Project:**\n\n- **Create a Python file** where you will define your FastAPI application (e.g., `main.py`).\n- **Set up a virtual environment** and install FastAPI and Uvicorn if you havenâ€™t already. This is essential for running your application.\n\n2. **Define Data Models:**\n\n- **Create Pydantic Models** for data validation:\n  - Define a `Recipe` model with fields such as `title`, `ingredients`, `instructions`, and `cook_time`.\n  - Define a `Movie` model with fields like `title`, `director`, `year`, and `genre`.\n\n3. **Simulate a Database:**\n\n- **Use Python dictionaries** to simulate a database for storing recipes and movies:\n  - Create a dictionary named `recipes_db` for storing recipes.\n  - Create another dictionary named `movies_db` for storing movies.\n  - Ensure that each entry is indexed by a unique identifier.\n\n4. **Implement CRUD Operations:**\n\n- **Create (POST Endpoint):**\n  - Define a POST endpoint to add a new recipe. Validate the input data using the `Recipe` model, assign a unique ID, and store the recipe in `recipes_db`.\n  - Similarly, create a POST endpoint for adding a new movie using the `Movie` model, storing it in `movies_db`.\n\n- **Read (GET Endpoints):**\n  - Implement a GET endpoint to retrieve all recipes from `recipes_db`. Return a list of all stored recipes.\n  - Create another GET endpoint to fetch a specific recipe by its ID, returning the data if found, or an appropriate error if not.\n  - Implement similar GET endpoints for movies, allowing retrieval of all movies or a specific movie by its ID.\n\n- **Update (PUT Endpoint):**\n  - Define a PUT endpoint to update an existing recipe. Check if the recipe exists in `recipes_db`. If it does, update its details and return a success message; if not, return an error.\n  - Implement a PUT endpoint for updating movie details, using a similar approach with `movies_db`.\n\n- **Delete (DELETE Endpoint):**\n  - Create a DELETE endpoint to remove a recipe by its ID. Check for its existence in `recipes_db`, delete it if found, and return a confirmation message; otherwise, return an error.\n  - Similarly, implement a DELETE endpoint for movies, allowing deletion by ID with appropriate checks.\n\n5. **Enhance API Documentation:**\n\n- **Use Detailed Docstrings:**\n  - For each endpoint, provide a clear and concise docstring that describes the endpointâ€™s purpose, parameters, expected responses, and possible errors. This enhances the auto-generated documentation at `/docs`.\n\n6. **Run the Application:**\n\n- **Start the FastAPI Server:**\n  - Use Uvicorn to run your application locally. This will enable you to test the CRUD operations and access the documentation.\n\nBy following these instructions, you will have a fully functional FastAPI application capable of managing a collection of recipes and movies, complete with CRUD operations and well-documented endpoints. \n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n## Overview\n\nIn this lab, you'll set up your environment and create foundational API endpoints.

This helps users understand different sections of your API.\n  \n  ```python\n  tags_metadata = [\n      {\n          \"name\": \"Introduction\",\n          \"description\": \"Basic introduction endpoints to get started.\",\n      },\n      {\n          \"name\": \"Recipe Management\",\n          \"description\": \"Endpoints for managing recipes including adding, retrieving, and deleting recipes.\",\n      },\n      {\n          \"name\": \"Movie Collection\",\n          \"description\": \"Endpoints for managing movie collections, including adding, retrieving, and deleting movies.\",\n      },\n  ]\n\n  app = FastAPI(\n      openapi_tags=tags_metadata  # Apply tags metadata to FastAPI instance\n  )\n  ```\n\n**2. Enhance Endpoint Documentation**\n\n- **Add Detailed Docstrings:**\n  - For each endpoint, provide comprehensive docstrings that explain the endpoint's purpose, input parameters, and expected responses. This enhances the auto-generated documentation and helps users understand how to interact with your API.\n\n  ```python\n  @app.get(\"/\", tags=[\"Introduction\"])\n  async def index():\n      \"\"\"\n      Returns a welcome message to introduce users to the API.\n\n      **Response:**\n      - `200`: A welcome message string.\n      \"\"\"\n      return {\"message\": \"Welcome to the Recipe and Movie Collection API!\"}\n  ```\n\n  ```python\n  @app.post(\"/recipes/\", tags=[\"Recipe Management\"])\n  async def add_recipe(recipe: Recipe):\n      \"\"\"\n      Add a new recipe to the collection.\n\n      **Request Body:**\n      - `title`: (string) The title of the recipe.\n      - `ingredients`: (list) The ingredients required.\n      - `instructions`: (string) The steps to prepare the recipe.\n\n      **Response:**\n      - `200`: Success message and the new recipe.\n      \"\"\"\n      # Recipe handling logic here\n      pass\n  ```\n\n**3. Further Customization**\n\n- **Add Contact, License, and Terms of Service Information:**\n  - Provide additional context about your API by including contact details, licensing information, and terms of service. This is especially useful for public or enterprise APIs.\n\n  ```python\n  app = FastAPI(\n      title=\"Recipe and Movie Collection API\",\n      description=\"An API for managing recipes and movie collections.\",\n      version=\"1.0.0\",\n      contact={\n          \"name\": \"API Support Team\",\n          \"email\": \"support@example.com\",\n          \"url\": \"https://example.com/support\"\n      },\n      license_info={\n          \"name\": \"MIT License\",\n          \"url\": \"https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT\",\n      },\n      terms_of_service=\"https://example.com/terms/\"\n  )\n  ```\n\n### 7. Putting It All Together\n\n<div class=\"video_holder\">\n  <video controls>\n    <source src=\"/01_Exercises/Putting It All Together.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\n    Your browser does not support the video tag.\n  </video>\n</div>\n\n1. **Setting Up the Project:**\n\n- **Create a Python file** where you will define your FastAPI application (e.g., `main.py`).\n- **Set up a virtual environment** and install FastAPI and Uvicorn if you havenâ€™t already. This is essential for running your application.\n\n2. **Define Data Models:**\n\n- **Create Pydantic Models** for data validation:\n  - Define a `Recipe` model with fields such as `title`, `ingredients`, `instructions`, and `cook_time`.\n  - Define a `Movie` model with fields like `title`, `director`, `year`, and `genre`.\n\n3. **Simulate a Database:**\n\n- **Use Python dictionaries** to simulate a database for storing recipes and movies:\n  - Create a dictionary named `recipes_db` for storing recipes.\n  - Create another dictionary named `movies_db` for storing movies.\n  - Ensure that each entry is indexed by a unique identifier.\n\n4. **Implement CRUD Operations:**\n\n- **Create (POST Endpoint):**\n  - Define a POST endpoint to add a new recipe. Validate the input data using the `Recipe` model, assign a unique ID, and store the recipe in `recipes_db`.\n  - Similarly, create a POST endpoint for adding a new movie using the `Movie` model, storing it in `movies_db`.\n\n- **Read (GET Endpoints):**\n  - Implement a GET endpoint to retrieve all recipes from `recipes_db`. Return a list of all stored recipes.\n  - Create another GET endpoint to fetch a specific recipe by its ID, returning the data if found, or an appropriate error if not.\n  - Implement similar GET endpoints for movies, allowing retrieval of all movies or a specific movie by its ID.\n\n- **Update (PUT Endpoint):**\n  - Define a PUT endpoint to update an existing recipe. Check if the recipe exists in `recipes_db`. If it does, update its details and return a success message; if not, return an error.\n  - Implement a PUT endpoint for updating movie details, using a similar approach with `movies_db`.\n\n- **Delete (DELETE Endpoint):**\n  - Create a DELETE endpoint to remove a recipe by its ID. Check for its existence in `recipes_db`, delete it if found, and return a confirmation message; otherwise, return an error.\n  - Similarly, implement a DELETE endpoint for movies, allowing deletion by ID with appropriate checks.\n\n5. **Enhance API Documentation:**\n\n- **Use Detailed Docstrings:**\n  - For each endpoint, provide a clear and concise docstring that describes the endpointâ€™s purpose, parameters, expected responses, and possible errors. This enhances the auto-generated documentation at `/docs`.\n\n6. **Run the Application:**\n\n- **Start the FastAPI Server:**\n  - Use Uvicorn to run your application locally. This will enable you to test the CRUD operations and access the documentation.\n\nBy following these instructions, you will have a fully functional FastAPI application capable of managing a collection of recipes and movies, complete with CRUD operations and well-documented endpoints.
