Students will learn how to containerize their applications using Docker and deploy them to cloud services such as Heroku or AWS, ensuring that the application can scale and handle real-world traffic.\n\n**Learning Objectives üß†**  \n\n- Identify the steps required for deploying a FastAPI application to a cloud platform.\n- List common cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, Heroku, GCP) and their basic services for web applications.\n- Describe the importance of Docker in creating reproducible environments for deployment. \n- Explain how scaling works on cloud platforms and why it is critical for handling increased traffic.\n- Containerize a FastAPI application using Docker and deploy it to a cloud service.\n- Implement environment variables and configurations for production environments.\n- Analyze the advantages and challenges of deploying a FastAPI application in the cloud versus on-premise.\n- Compare different deployment strategies (manual vs. automated CI/CD pipelines).\n- Evaluate the performance of a deployed FastAPI application under different traffic conditions.\n\n## Assessment and Evaluation\n\n- **Lectures**: Participation and engagement in live sessions.\n- **Exercises**: Hands-on coding tasks that will be graded based on completion and accuracy.\n- **Final Project**: A capstone project where students will build, document, and deploy a complete FastAPI-based API.\n- **Instructor Feedback**: Personalized feedback will be provided throughout the course to ensure continuous improvement.\n\n## Expectations for Students  \nStudents are expected to actively participate in all lectures, complete exercises on time, and engage with their peers in group discussions or projects. Continuous feedback will be provided to help students improve.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n## Course Overview\n\nThis course offers an introduction to FastAPI, a high-performance Python web framework designed for building APIs quickly and efficiently.\n\nThrough a mix of lectures, coding exercises, and hands-on projects, students will develop the skills necessary to build, manage, and deploy APIs, with a focus on scalability, asynchronous operations, and modern development practices.\n\n## Course Structure\n- üìö **[Lectures](/00_Lectures/index.qmd)**: Theory and live coding examples to boost your understanding.\n\n- üõ†Ô∏è **[Exercises](/01_Exercices/index.qmd)**: Hands-on tasks to solidify your skills.\n\n- üéì **[Instructor Files](/02_Instructors/index.qmd)**: Teaching resources, including solutions and assessments.\n\n## Syllabus\n\n### Lecture 1.
